"If you put your mind to it, you can be good to yourself all of the time."

Stuff which I once wanted to do for KC:

1.bells and whistles for selector
2.sound
3.proper multiplayer support

4.--help and --version responses.
5./? response : they --help. GNU like that.
6.Other frivious stuff and easter eggs.

condense 4 and 5 into one text patch loaded from the datafile.

7.add support for internal datafile as a fallback.

7.b.seperate datafile loading to preshadow contextual segmentation and 
hence refactoring for modularity. 

7.c.add support for kcfile.dat as a fall forward.

8.make the name and location of the screendump file changeable.
