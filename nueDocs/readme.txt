ReadMe for KC1,
aka KC15 - DOS32 section.

To Play:

Currently only "hotseat" play is supported, two people at the same console ("computer",
to the common creature).

Use arrow keys to select a man, 
Enter or Space to confirm the selection.

The text at the top will guide you as to what the state of the cursor is.

Gameplay is as per "Supercheckers":

1. Each player must Slide a piece into the Inner Area 
2. The Second Player must move from the Opposite Side, neither same nor adjacent.
3. From then on, at least one of your pieces must inhabit the Inner Area,
or you lose the game!
4. Thus, play continues until you eliminate the other sides' pieces 
within the Inner Area.

More details later, and gameplay would be streamlined as well.

Next major step is to log the games so that they can be replayed / viewed as records.
