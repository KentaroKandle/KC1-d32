# KC1-d32
Knight Cross I - DOS32 Edition

Well, this was a sacrificial bishop type project. 

Just as Bishops (in Chess) can't go onto squares of a different color, this codebase can't really be used for much.

Not only because I wrote it for DOS32, which was obsolete even back then 
(I started it on a Windows 95 machine, iirc, so the obvious thing would have been to use Visual C++,
or Borland or Delphi -- but we all know how well Microsoft treated their "partners" in tool creation),
but rather, just because it was badly written.

Rather than doing "Hello World", I wanted to do a significant project to learn Allegro, 
so I chose one with low graphical demands that I could write quickly.

However, the internal workings were horrible, and what I learnt about modular programming, I used
in other projects and eventually caried to Python based projects, because Python is simply faster to wrtie in,
faster to refactor, and thus, faster to refactor.

At the point where you need to deploy, you can even compile modern Python or embed the interpeter. 

The upsides which were in the traditional C/ASM communities, which were lost a bit in the OOP/C++/JAVA communities,
are present in the Python design and communities with more vigor. 

In general, passion follows hot platforms, and for expressing new types of things, Python has a great advantage here.

Ruby and such are just about the same... golang as well, but since I had already come across Python, I keep working in it.

The version of the project I have put here wasn't completely working. I got it to work, but I wanted to do more,
esp. replace the sprite rips in spchar.dat with generic graphics (for now) and hopefully refactor the code, 
but you know, C is really more work than Python and in the meantime I've re-implemented it in Python almost totally.

Unlike most developers, however, I can't afford to specialize in software development yet. Perhaps never, really, 
but it is good to have hobbies even if they are hard and worthless. 

Sadly, this project is the worse code I have ever written. 

Nearly ever line needs revising, and they are too many lines;

For both enjoyment and providing a good example, the Python codebase would be better, but I'll prob. work on a fork 
of Sopel first, since that involves networking and I have some professional ambitions in that area, anyhow. 

I don't really have that much interest in DOS32 (but I can obviously build stuff on it already,
esp. with DOSBOX under Linux working so well, it even works better there than on Windows), 
and the "challenges" of using C/C++ on that platform, 
but I don't like to leave things unfinished. 

So I'll eventually update this project with fully working code, 
if all things go well.

I won't promise it soon, and if I am too tired from the metaphorical digging of ditches to make a living,
then obviously it will never happen... so we'll see how it goes.
